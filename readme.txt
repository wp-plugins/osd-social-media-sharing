OSD Social Media Sharing is extremely light weight and does not require external libraries to share your WordPress content on social media sites.

== Description ==

OSD Social Media Sharing gives the ability to add sharing buttons anywhere on your site with a shortcode, or automatically generate them based on post type. This plugin is very similar to Jet Pack sharing without all of the bloat and external requests. Place sharing in sidebars / widget areas using the WordPress text widget and the OSD Social Media Sharing shortcode. Place the buttons in any content field with the shortcode as well. Simple administration can be found under the settings tab including Drag and Drop re-ordering of the buttons, and the ability to add your own sharing icons. Remove the icons on a per post basis using the check box in the right sidebar of the edit post screen. This plugin does not hook into the content filter for post type based display!! this means that the sharing buttons will only appear ONE time on your pages, not all over the place like some other plugins.

Shortcode:
